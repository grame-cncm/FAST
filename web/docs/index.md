# FAST: Fast Audio Signal-processing Technologies on FPGA

<img src="img/logoFAST.png" class="mx-auto d-block" width="30%">

FAST (ANR-20-CE38-0001) was (2021-2025) a research project funded by the [Agence Nationale de la Recherche](https://anr.fr/) (ANR -- the French National Research Agency). It gathered the strength of [GRAME-CNCM](https://www.grame.fr), [CITI Lab (INSA Lyon)](http://www.citi-lab.fr/), and [LMFA (École Centrale Lyon)](http://lmfa.ec-lyon.fr/?lang=en) towards two goals: 

* facilitating the design of ultra-low latency embedded systems for real-time audio signal processing,
* using such systems in the context of active control of acoustics.

## Timeline

FAST begun in March 2021 and ended in January 2025. 

## Partners

FAST involved 6 permanent faculty, 2 PhD students, 1 postdoc, and 3 interns, spread out over 3 main institutions: GRAME-CNCM, CITI Lab @ INSA Lyon, and LMFA @ École Centrale Lyon.

### GRAME-CNCM

GRAME is a "Centre National de Création Musicale" (National Centre for Musical Creation) funded by the French ministry of culture, the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region and the city of Lyon. It is organized in three departments: production/music creation, transmission, and research. GRAME's research department hosts four permanent researchers as well as PhD students, postdocs, engineers, interns, etc. Its activities focus on music technology and computer music. GRAME is the birthplace of the [Faust programming language](https://faust.grame.fr) which is used at the heart of FAST.

### CITI Lab @ INSA Lyon

CITI is an academic laboratory associated with [INSA Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/en/) and [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/fr). The CITI Laboratory develops research activities bringing together computer science, networking, and digital communications to address the challenging issues related to the development of Internet. One of CITI's research focus is on FPGAs which are heavily used as part of FAST. 

### LMFA @ École Centrale Lyon

The LMFA is the Laboratoire de Mécanique des Fluides et d'Acoustique (Fluid Mechanics and Acoustics Laboratory). It hosts researchers from [École Centrale Lyon](https://www.ec-lyon.fr/), [INSA Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/en/), [Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1](https://www.univ-lyon1.fr/) and [CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/fr). The members of LMFA associated to the FAST project specialize in acoustics active control which is one of the focus of FAST.
