## PhD: Ultra-Low Latency Audio Processing on FPGA Through High Level Synthesis

**Starting Date:** Anytime between March and September 2021.

The objective of this PhD is to combine the [Faust programming language](https://faust.grame.fr), High Level Synthesis tools, and [FloPoCo](http://flopoco.gforge.inria.fr/) to implement a "Faust to FPGA compiler" to facilitate the design of FPGA-based systems for ultra-low latency (less than 50 microseconds) real-time audio signal processing.
