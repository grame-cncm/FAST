## PhD: Ultra-Low Latency Audio Processing on FPGA Through High Level Synthesis

**Starting Date:** Anytime between March and September 2021.

The objective of this PhD is to combine the [Faust programming language](https://faust.grame.fr), High Level Synthesis tools, and [FloPoCo](http://flopoco.gforge.inria.fr/) to implement a "Faust to FPGA compiler" to facilitate the design of FPGA-based systems for ultra-low latency (less than 50 microseconds) real-time audio signal processing.

## Masters Internship: Faust2FPGA: Compilation from Faust to VHDL

**Starting Date:** First half of 2021

**Duration:** 6 months

The goal of this masters internship is to compile the [Faust programming language](https://faust.grame.fr) to VHDL without using High Level Synthesis (HLS). This tool will be integrated in a "Faust to FPGA compiler" to facilitate the design of FPGA-based systems for ultra-low latency (less than 50 microseconds) real-time audio signal processing.
